# DGF & eGFR Prediction Streamlit App  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is being developed in collaboration with the **University of Maryland Biostatistics Lab**.  
The goal is to build a **Streamlit web application** that displays machine learning model results for:  
- **Delayed Graft Function (DGF)** → *Binary classification model (Yes/No)*  
- **1-Year Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)** → *Continuous regression model*  

The app provides clinicians and researchers with an **interactive interface** to upload datasets, run models, and visualize predictive outcomes for kidney transplant patients.

## ⚙️ Features (Planned & In Progress)  
- Upload CSV/Excel datasets containing clinical and pathomic features  
- Run trained ML models to generate predictions  
- Interactive visualizations of:  
  - **DGF classification probabilities**  
  - **eGFR regression outputs & residuals**  
- Clinician-friendly dashboards with key metrics  
- Modular design for future model integration

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (scikit-learn, statsmodels, pandas, numpy)  
- **Streamlit** (frontend web app)  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** (visualizations)  
- **SQL / Azure SQL** (data storage & queries)  
- **GitHub** (version control & collaboration)

## 🚀 Project Status  
🔄 **In Progress** – Initial Streamlit app prototype under development.  
Future updates will include:  
- Model benchmarking results  
- User-friendly dashboards  
- Deployment options (local & cloud-hosted)
